# ML-DL_Algorithms
A repository of algorithms used for artificial intelligence.

## Current Projects in Repository:

### Neural Networks:

#### Neural Network Version 1
* Simple neural network based off of a common tutorial.
* Limitedly uses Numpy.
* 2 inputs, 2 neurons, 1 hidden layer, 1 output.
* Created for learning purposes

#### Neural Network Version 2
* Made with no external libraries.
* Uses standard lists as its primary iterable for number manipulation.
* Uses the sigmoid function as its activation function.
* single class.
* Freely adjustable number of:
  * inputs
  * hidden layers
  * neurons per hidden layer
  * outputs
* Complete with two examples of networks with different model and training settings.
* Accurate with 1 output, but struggles with more.
* Evaluation functions used to mitigate its unpredictability by using the most accurate version found over many iterations.

#### Neural Network Version 3
* Made with no external libraries.
* Object oriented.
* Hierarchical structure. (Network conductions a list of layers, the layers conduct a list of neurons/nodes)
* More consistent than previous iterations.
* Most acceptably written code.
